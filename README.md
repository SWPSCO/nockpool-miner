This repo includes code and binaries necessary to participate in [Nockpool](https://nockpool.com), the premier [Nockchain](https://nockchain.org) mining pool, with your Linux or Apple Silicon machines.

### Install

You can download the prebuilt binaries in the release tab. The macOS bins are codesigned and the Linux bins are SLSA3 attested -- we recommend [verifying](https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-verifier).


### Run


```
miner-linux-x86_64 --key nockpool_yourdevicekeyhere123  --max-threads 12
```

## FAQ

#### Where do I get a device key?

Create an account at [nockpool.com](https://nockpool.com) to create device keys.

#### How many threads should I use?

Logical cores times two minus 4 is a good rule of thumb. E.g., if you have a 16 core Ryzen capable of 32 threads, 28 would be a good target.

#### How much memory do I need?

As much as you can get! Recommended minimum 6GB per thread.


#### How do I use custom jets?

Just swap out the `zkvm-jetpack` dependency in `Cargo.toml`.
